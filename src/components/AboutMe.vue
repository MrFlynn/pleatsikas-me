        Hello there! I'm Nick, a computer engineering student at the 
          <a class="underline" href="https://ucr.edu">University of California, Riverside</a>.
        My focus is on studying high performance computing and networking. My senior year will
        be spent taking design level courses in computer networking, concurrent and parallel 
        systems, and GPU programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, I worked at an AI startup doing software engineering called 
          <a class="underline" href="https://minds.ai">Minds.ai</a>.
        I worked on building developer tools and infrastructure/business automation software.
        During my time I developed my skills building production grade 
        applications in Python.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work and studying I'm a member of my university's Cybersecurity club. 
        I recently participated in 
          <a class="underline" href="https://wrccdc.org">CCDC</a>
        where my team placed in the western regional competion and got 3rd in infrastructure 
        uptime. I'm also an avid soccer player, gym goer, and foodie.

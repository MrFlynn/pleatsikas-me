        Hello there! I'm Nick, a recent computer engineering graduate from
          <a class="underline" href="https://ucr.edu">University of California, Riverside</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, I worked at an AI startup called 
          <a class="underline" href="https://minds.ai">Minds.ai</a> where I 
        built and scaled their cloud and datacenter environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work and school I like to play soccer and rock climb. I also
        love to cook.
